# budgettracker

Getting Started
This project focuses on Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). Progressive web apps aim to blend the benefits of a traditional browser experience with those of a mobile application. PWAs may utilize the Service Worker and Cache APIs to cache assets and API responses to ensure applications work without an internet connection.

Online/Offline Budget Trackers
Using a previously created Budget Tracker application, a user is able to update information while online/offline. Updated application has offline access and functionality.

The user is able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, the total will be populated when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:

  * Enter deposits and expenses offline

When brought back online:

  * Offline entries added to tracker.

Business Context
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

Built With PWAs may utilize the Service Worker and Cache APIs to cache assets and API responses to ensure applications work without an internet connection.
